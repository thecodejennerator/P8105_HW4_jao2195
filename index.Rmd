## <font size="4"> About Me </font> 
Hello! My name is Jennifer A. Osei ! 
I born and raised in Buffalo, New York (the second largest city in New York, next to New York City). It is very close to Toronto, Canada.

My parents and family are from Accra, Ghana in West Africa and to this day I am not to sure why they choose one of the coldest places in the United States to call home but many years later we are still here! :) 

I grew up with wonderful Ghanaian foods and dishes that I cannot imagine living without, such as
Kontomire (pronounced: kon-TOME-er-aye), Fufu, and of course, Jollof Rice, just to name a few. I grew up in a home where education and knowledge were highly valued. We enjoy learning and teaching each other in out day to day. I developed interests in music, nature, teaching, math and science in fun and easy ways to teach kids of all backgrounds, especially problem solving and coding. 
 
##  <font size="4"> Academics </font> 
I graduated from Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) in 2014 in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Computational Biology. My love and fascination for the usefulness and applicability of coding and mathematics motivated me to dive in to mathematics more. After graduation, I completed the Harvard University Summer Program in Computational Biology and Biostatistics in 2015. 

Currently, I attend Columbia University in the City of New York and I am working towards my 
MS in Biostatistics.
